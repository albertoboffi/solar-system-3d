# Approximations

The simulator is based on the following approximations, considered acceptable at least in a first version:
* The initial Î¸ angle of the planets with respect to the rotation axis does not depend on the position along the orbit.
* The inclination of the planets is set with respect to the y-axis rather than the orbital axis.
* Planets are rendered as spheres. A more specific approximation could be made by using geoids instead of ellipsoids.
